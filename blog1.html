        <h1>From Ember to Inferno 13/3/2021</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          t's more like a spark than a ember but I think it sounds much much
          cooler. Don't you think? Plus it's one of my favourite albums by
          Trivium. This is how I got into programming (cough* clears throught).
          <br />
          So I was just a not so regular child I think I was like six playing
          saga on sonic, my god I loved that game, I said to my parents <br />
          I wanna do things like this I want to make them move, they thought it
          was interesting. I never really thought of it much more until I was 14
          in a computer lesson in school. <br />
          I asked the teacher if they knew how to code. they said and I shit you
          not " you are not smart enough or young enough then I said out loud
          like a typical British kid " oh bollocks" <br />
          they gave me wrong and sent me to the headmaster <br />
          <br />
          but in the end I was not in the wrong the dumb ass teacher was for
          saying what they said, oh and the funny thing was she stopped teaching
          IT. <br />
          I asked the headmaster if he could make a dinner class for programming
          a he said he would but not enough interest, I wish I knew I could of
          Googled it back then. <br />
          I was streaming one day in 2019 on twitch talking to my self about how
          I wanna do programming and I had no idea where I would of started,
          then I got a call. <br />
          The call was about programming, mostly about fullstack web
          development. <br />
          <br />
          We had a chat on the phone and I was excited to start. I started that
          course within the week and i enjoyed it but not the set up plus I had
          to pay 5 grand. <br />
          I decided to cancel it and learn my self I did I learned a bit of html
          but life happend like my grandad got sick so I stopped and I went down
          hill my anxiety and depression started to get worse and worse. <br />
          I said to my partner I can't live like this anymore I'm overwright and
          I'm sick of my mental health, so I said we should start going to the
          gym and so we did. <br />
          Then my mental health started getting better so I said to my partner
          by the end of next year in going to get a job. <br />
          I started applying and then 2020 happened the pandemic happend the
          stupid coronavirus decided to pop up and said ha nah dude you not
          doing shit this year, <br />
          <br />
          my mental health went down hill quick I couldn't see my family I
          couldn't go to the gym there was no work. Then the lockdown got lifted
          I saw my family <br />
          for a bit then another lockdown then it got lifted then I got the
          stupid virus in november, I never felt so shit in my life man I was in
          bed for two damn weeks I couldn't <br />
          get up without being out of breathe and I have damn asthma, I couldn't
          even have a shit without feeling faint either or feel like I'm gonna
          hurl, I mean dude when I'm sick it's normally for a day but two f##8ng
          weeks it honestly felt like food poisoning. It did pass thank f#&k for
          that. Christmas rolls around my partner and I went down to her
          family's for Christmas it was nice felt normal. And then the third
          lockdown comes but I'm taking advantage this time I'm using the time
          to study and by the looks of it. It's going pretty damn well.
