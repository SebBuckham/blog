        Where I have been. Where I'm going My birth name is Sebastian named
        after the singer <br />
        from skid row, tho i liked to be called seb. I am studying Web
        Development. I have dyslexia, <br />
        Depression and anxiety and it sucks but I don't let it stop me. It just
        means I get my letters mixed up and I learn <br />
        things slower than the average person so i have been told. This blog is
        mostly about my journey from living off benefits because <br />
        <br />
        of mental health to learning front end web Development, and how i wanted
        to learn how to program and get into my dream job <br />
        as a front end web developer. I hope to bring you all along on my
        journey via this blog. I do have other interests, such as streaming on
        twitch, playing games in general. I tend to watch a lot i mean alot of
        movies and i like to chill with my animals on my down time. <br />

          It's more like a spark than a ember but I think it sounds much much
          cooler. Don't you think? <br />
          Plus it's one of my favourite albums by Trivium. This is how I got
          into programming <br />
          (cough* clears throught).So. I was just a not so regular child I think
          I was like six playing saga on sonic...
