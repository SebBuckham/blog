        Where I have been. Where I'm going My birth name is Sebastian named
        after the singer from skid row, tho i liked to be called seb . <br />
        I am studying Web Development. I have dyslexia, Depression and anxiety
        and it sucks but I don't let it stop me. <br />
        It just means I get my letters mixed up and I learn things slower than
        the average person so i have been told. <br />
        <br />
        This blog is mostly about my journey from living off benefits because of
        mental health to landing my first part time job as a cleaner near me
        <br />
        and how i wanted to learn how to program and get into my dream job as a
        front end web developer. <br />
        I hope to bring you all along on my journey via this blog. I do have
        other interests, such as streaming on twitch, playing games in general.
        <br />
        I tend to watch a lot i mean alot of movies and i like to chill with my
        animals on my down time.
